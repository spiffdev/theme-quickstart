# Theme Quickstart

This is a small theme that implements some of the most common features of our API. It serves as an example of how to manage steps, selections and design submission.

A few notes on libraries used. The project runs and builds using webpack. We've configured to output a single file for easily deploying. You may like to chunk instead. We've also used React for UI. Keep in mind we can also run in Vue, Angular or vanilla JS.

## Getting Started

The process is simple. We used yarn while building this but you could easily switch to npm.

-   yarn
-   yarn start
-   yarn build
